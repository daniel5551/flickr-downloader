# Flcikr Downloader
A simple Pyhon script to download Flickr profiles with photos description.

## Arguments
You can use this script inside terminal with arguments, like ```--description```, ```--pid```, and ```--uid```. to automatize this boring process.

## Why?
I need to download my favorite photographer's works ([JolsAriella](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jolsariella)), but I don't even found any working script, that can download photos with descriptions, so i write my own. This is my only motivation. You can use my API-key and Secret for free.
